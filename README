ChokePoint Bulletin Board System v. 1.5.5

The CPBBS is a simple BBS type program that is run in the console.
CPBBS can easily be configured to run on your modem, or listen on a TCP 
port.

Setting up CPBBS to run on your modem:
To setup agetty to answer the phone on the first ring use the following command.

**NOTE** Before using the following command you need to initialize your modem
with a program like minicom, and exit without resetting the modem.

# agetty -m 38400,19200,9600,2400,1200 modem vt100 -n -w -l 
/home/cpbbs/cpbbs -I 'ATS0=1\015'

Change the =1 to =x to answer after x rings.

Setting up CPBBS to run on a TCP port:
First off you need to make sure you have netcat on your system.

# nc -l -p 42448 -e /home/cpbbs/cpbbs

Neither of these commands will restart the BBS after the person exits. If you want
to accomplish this using agetty, look in /etc/inittab. To do the same thing using 
netcat... Write your own.

Also works great as a shell for ssh / linux console. Just change in
/etc/passwd for the user...
